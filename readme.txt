* Sliders are responsive and will scale to fit their surrounding container.
* Two slider types included by default - [Flexslider](http://flexslider.woothemes.com) and [Roundabout](http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout)
* Slider types are extendable through Theme Blvd framework API. - [View Docs](http://dev.themeblvd.com/tutorial/add-custom-slider/)
